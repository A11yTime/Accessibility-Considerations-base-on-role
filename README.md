# During design I ensure: 
* Color choices (proper color contrast)
* Alternative text for images
* Heading level
* links/button text
* Form level
* Error message
* Visual focus color
* User interaction
* Keyboard functionality.
* Design fit with different viewport sizes.

# During development I ensure:
* Page language
* Meaningful page title
* Page structue with good semantics
* Logical reading order
* Programmatically determinable link/button text
* Programmatically determinable form label and error message
* All action provide immediate feedback that is programmatically determined.


# Accessibility Considerations base on role
### Basic consideratons:
* Provide information and unique page title
* Use heading convey meaning and structure
* Make link text meaningful
* Write meaningfull text alternatives for images
* Creates transcripts and captions for multimedia

* Keep content clear and conscise

### Considerations for designer:
* Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background
* Don't use color alone to convey information
* Ensure that interactive elements are easy to indentify
* Ensure form elements includes clearly associated labels
* Provide easy indentifiable feedback
* Use headings and spacing to group related content
* Create design for different viewport sizes
* include images and mdedia alternative in your design
* Provide control for content that starts automatically

### Considerations for Developer:
* Associate a label with every form control
* Include alternative text for images
* Identify page language and language changes
* Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure
* Help users avoid and correct mistakes
* Reflect the reading order in the code order
* Write code that adapts to the user's technology
* Provide meaning for non-standard interactive elements
* Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
* Avoid CAPTCHAT where possible, if CAPTCHA is required provide CAPTCHA alterntive.
